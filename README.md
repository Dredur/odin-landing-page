# odin-landing-page
Landing Page as an exercise from the Foundation Course of the Odin Project.

I even tried to make it a little bit responsive and experimented with units like vh, vw, % and so on.

I also learned, that a %-Value in a padding takes the width from the parent. There is even an article about this: https://css-tricks.com/oh-hey-padding-percentage-is-based-on-the-parent-elements-width/
